  My interest in web development stemmed from my passion for building tools with my hands and doing something new each day. Since i was 14 i spend most of my time between developing websites and making short movies.

  <span>H</span>ave something to tell or just having fun playing with special effects are what i need to start creating some of my movies.
  I can't remember when or why i was searching how to do some effect when i found <strong>AE</strong> (after effects). <br />
  <span>M</span>ost of my movies are offline but if you are clever enough you can find some of them.<br />
  I like everything to be consistent both in my movies, at work and in life. For that reason i always search the best and cleanest way to do my projects.

  <h3>Always improving</h3>
  <p>
  <span>D</span>O MORE, WORK HARD, IMPROVE YOURSELF. Find your limit and push it.<br />
  Everywhere you will find people stronger than you, people smarter than you but you will always be the hardest working person.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span>S</span>port make you better, faster, awake. Sport helps you find the limit not only your body but also the limit of your mind.
  I really love do sport outside, run and all kind of old school exercise:<br />
  push ups,pull ups, squats, burpees... You can find me in Freeletics app as <i>Jorge Chato</i>.
